## Example Components
The `Loaders/LoadingWheel.js`, and `Modal/ModalWrapper.js` component are example components that along with their test's demonstrate how to build testable components.  Babel-Jest and Enzyme are powerful testing tools and can be very useful for testing.

### Example Test's
The tests for the previously mentioned components are in the tests directory. You can place a test directory in the root of any client folder and mern-kit will automatically run them when you run `docker-compose run web npm test`.
