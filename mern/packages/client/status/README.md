Status Pages
============
> This section is responsible for rendering the various status pages, e.g 403.pug, 404.pug, 500.pug, etc.

The look and feel of that status page's can be customized in this directory. Pug is rendering the pages with a few global variables that the component will use for rendering. You can expect to have a `title` and a `message`. The title is the same as the document title and the message is a little bit more of a user friendly description of why they are there.
